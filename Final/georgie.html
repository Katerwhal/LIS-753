                                Georgie, short for Georgiana, is my most recently acquired cat. She came to me through a series of hands, starting with a friends sister. She had found Georgie as a tiny kitten, seemingly abandoned in her backyard. She was about 5-6 weeks old at that point. Unfortunately, her cat allergies were too much for her, and so she gave Georgie to my friend while they find someone to adopt her. I visited her during this time and instantly fell in love with Georgie's tenacity and curiosity.

                                I continued to feed her soft kitten food for several weeks until she was big enough for kibble. After six months, she was already almost as big as Celty! Her curiosity inspired her name, ala 'Curious George'. She is a tuxedo cat, so I also wanted a fancy enough name to go with her coloring. She was so small when I got her that I called her Munchkin. Even though she is bigger than Celty now, I still call her that sometimes, because her meow is still so small.
