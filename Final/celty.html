                                Celty is my first cat as an adult. She is the daughter of my brother's cat, who had become pregnant unexpectedly. She and her littermates grew up traveling around with my brother, from short trips to our parents to all the way to Colorado for a week-long visit.

                                She basically has the negative coloration of her mom, long fur and all. She is very chill, and prefers laying in the sun to running around. She is also very attached to me and insists on laying on my chest as often as she can. Her namesake is a character from the show 'Durarara', who wears a black motorcycle helmet with cat ears. I was waffling between Celty and Andromeda (because of her coloring), and ultimately chose the anime route over the space theme. She is called Princess because she has a lofty vibe and meows at me whenever she wants me to do something.
