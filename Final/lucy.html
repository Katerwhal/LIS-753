                            <h2 id="subtitle">Born August 21, 2016</h2>
                            <p>
                                Lucy was my first pet, whom I adopted from a coworker in 2016. Her mom is a Dauchshund and Chihuahua designer mix and her dad is unknown, but it was likely a Schnauzer in the neighborhood. She was unfortunately kept away from her mom too early, and so she grew up with some development issues. She was very cautious around new people, places, and sounds. She still is, to an extent, but has become much more confident and trusting with some training and confidence work.

                                She has been by my side from small town Kansas through several moves until we ended up in Colorado. Her name was given by the children in her mom's house, who said that whoever got her would be 'lucky', and so begat that name. I definitely count myself lucky to have her. I call her Wiggles because of how much she wiggles her whole body whenever she's excited.
